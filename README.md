# Disease_Prediction
This project uses data from Kaggle. Source:https://www.kaggle.com/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning. 
The goal for this project is to develop a classification model that can predict prognosis based on presence or absence of symptoms. Each column represents a symptom, each row represents a participant in the study. 132 features were examined with 41 possible prognoses, making this a multiclass classification problem. LightGBM proves to be highly effective with over 99% accuracy.
